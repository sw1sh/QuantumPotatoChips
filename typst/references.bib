  abstract = "First steps are taken toward a formulation of quantum mechanics
              which avoids the use of probability amplitudes and is expressed
              entirely in terms of observable probabilities. Quantum states are
              represented not by state vectors or density matrices but by
              “probability tables,” which contain only the probabilities of the
              outcomes of certain special measurements. The rule for computing
              transition probabilities, normally given by the squared modulus of
              the inner product of two state vectors, is re-expressed in terms
              of probability tables. The new version of the rule is surprisingly
              simple, especially when one considers that the notion of complex
              phases, so crucial in the evaluation of inner products, is
              entirely absent from the representation of states used here.",
